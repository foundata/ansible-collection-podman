v1.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Release Date: 2026-08-28

Maintenance release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- ``host``, ``quadlet`` - Improve Ansible compatibility for roles and collections used in the wild by giving every loop in the roles a private, purpose-specific loop variable derived from the role's public variable prefix (for example ``__quadlet_podman_*_item``) instead of ``item``. This avoids rebinding a caller's ``item`` when role parameters reference it, such as when a role itself is included from a loop, and makes the roles behave more robustly across common Ansible usage patterns.
